# Document Hub Development Plan

---

## Phase 1 – User Experience Enhancements

**Objective:** Improve the usability and overall visual polish of the application.

### Planned Improvements
- Add a **Theme Switcher** allowing users to toggle between light and dark UI styles.
- Introduce a **Command Palette** (Ctrl + P) to quickly access commands and files through fuzzy search.
- Implement an **Improved Undo/Redo System** for organizer actions, allowing complete reversible operations.

**Outcome:** A more user-friendly, visually refined experience with enhanced control and accessibility.

## Phase 2 – Advanced AI and Semantic Search

**Objective:** Introduce intelligent search and contextual understanding using AI models.

### Planned Improvements
- Develop a **Semantic Search Engine** to retrieve results based on conceptual meaning using embeddings (e.g., sentence-transformers or Gemini API).
- Add **AI Category Refinement**, allowing the AI to learn from user feedback and adjust its tagging accuracy.
- Introduce **Contextual Summaries** that provide relevant summaries based on user queries.
- Enable **Folder-Level Summaries** to generate quick overviews of entire directories.

**Outcome:** Document Hub evolves into an intelligent assistant capable of understanding context and meaning beyond simple keyword matches.

## Phase 3 – Smart Automation Expansion

**Objective:** Extend automation capabilities to reduce repetitive file management.

### Planned Improvements
- Expand the **Smart Rules Engine** with user-defined conditions and dynamic actions.
- Add a **Scheduled Auto-Organizer** that runs cleanup and classification tasks periodically in the background.

**Outcome:** Automated file management with intelligent scheduling, ensuring an organized and efficient workspace with minimal manual intervention.

## Phase 4 – Collaboration and Cloud Integration

**Objective:** Transform Document Hub into a connected platform supporting multiple users and devices.

### Planned Improvements
- Integrate **Cloud Folder Sync** for optional connection with Google Drive, Dropbox, or WebDAV.
- Introduce a **Multi-User Shared Index** using PostgreSQL to support collaborative document indexing.
- Add a **Secure Remote Search API** (FastAPI-based) for network or web-based access.
- Build an **Analytics Dashboard** to visualize file activity, tag usage, and system metrics.

**Outcome:** A multi-user and cloud-enabled system that supports remote work, collaboration, and insightful analytics.

## Phase 5 – AI-Powered Insights and Extensibility

**Objective:** Extend Document Hub with intelligent insights and customizable extensions.

### Planned Improvements
- Add **Voice Command Support** for hands-free control and AI-based interaction.
- Implement **AI Document Comparison** to summarize version differences between documents.
- Create a **Knowledge Graph Visualization** to explore relationships between documents by content and tags.
- Develop **Automated Report Generation** for research summaries, progress tracking, or meeting notes.
- Build a **Plugin Framework** to allow external developers to extend the application with custom modules.

**Outcome:** Document Hub transitions into a complete, extensible, and AI-augmented knowledge management platform capable of deep analysis and adaptive workflows.
